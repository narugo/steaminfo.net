    <p><strong>Here you can find Steam users by their Community ID, Steam ID, or Vanity URL.</strong></p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Community ID:</b> 76561197968575517
        <br /><b>Steam ID:</b> STEAM_0:1:4154894 (or simply 0:1:4154894)
        <br /><b>Vanity URL:</b> ChetFaliszek
    </p>
    <p>
        You can get Community ID form URL to user's page on Steam Community website. It looks something like this:
        <em>http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/<strong title="You need to input this part of the URL">76561197968575517</strong>/</em><br />
        If you are looking for a user who already created himself so called vanity URL, you can use it too. Here's how it
        looks like: <em>http://steamcommunity.com/id/<strong title="You need to input this part of the URL">ChetFaliszek</strong>/</em>
